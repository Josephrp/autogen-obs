    ## Main Benefits of LangChain:
    * It simplifies the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for specific tasks.
    * Allows combining the power of LLMs with other programming techniques.
    * Provides an ability to control and influence LLM's output via prompts.
    * Memory feature allowing LLM to learn from previous interactions and build a knowledge base.
    * Offers unique components like Chains, which are sequences of instructions executed to perform a task.
    * Facilitates the construction of unique and complex chains of instructions that can perform sophisticated operations.

    ## Main Modules of LangChain:
    * **Models**: Large language models trained on massive datasets of text and code.
    * **Prompts**: Pieces of text that guide the LLM to generate the desired output.
    * **Chains**: Sequences of instructions the LangChain framework executes to perform a task.
    * **Memory**: A method of storing data that the LLM can access later.
    * **Indexes**: Unique data structures to store information about the data content.
    * **Agents and Tools**: Agents are reusable components that can perform specific tasks, while Tools are function libraries to aid in developing various agents.
